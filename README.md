# GEM5-Systems
Analysis on Computer Organization using the GEM5 simulator
The gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor microarchitecture.

With recent hardware security comprimises such as *Spectre* and *Meltdown*, this repository serves to use GEM5 to build and test systems with the intent of 
* Reducing leakage speculation, or speculation footprints.
* Restricting side-channeling.
* Dynammic speculation throttling.
